// In programming, a "thread" is like a set of instructions that a computer program follows. When a program is single-threaded, it can only do one thing at a time. If a task takes a long time to complete, the whole program becomes unresponsive.
// To solve this, web workers are introduced. Workers allow you to run some tasks in a separate thread, so you can start a task, then continue with other tasks without making the whole program unresponsive. 

// to solve this issue, web workers are introduced. Workers allow you to run some tasks in a separate thread, so you can start a task, continue with other tasks without making the whole program unresponsive. This is useful for long-running operations.

// However, there is a concern with multiple threads accessing the same data, which can lead to unexpected changes and bugs. To prevent this, the main code and worker code in web workers don't have direct access to each other's data. They can only communicate by sending messages.
